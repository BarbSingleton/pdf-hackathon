Captricity Analysis
====Southerland (Typed PDF entry, 4 pages)- Planned field entry: 71- Actual field entry: 18- Vendor error: 2 fields   2/18= 11.1% wrong or 88.9% accurate.- Time: 1 hour to receive the output file. - More investigation needed: Amount of Income / Ranges Pg. 2, col. F- The Headings on the spreadsheet need adjustment. Take out “Page 1” “Page 2” etc. out of the Heading and just leave the real title. - No commas or dollar signs were entered in the number ranges.- Empty spaces were filled with “—Blank—“. Take this out and leave the space blank / empty. Paulsen (Written PDF entry, 7 pages)- Planned field entry: 245- Actual field entry: 35 – (just the first line)- Vendor error: 3 fields.  3/35 = 8.6% wrong or 91.4% accuracy.- Time: 1 hour 38 minutes to receive the output file. - The Headings on the spreadsheet need adjustment. Take out “Page 1” “Page 2” etc. out of the Heading and just leave the real title. - No commas or dollar signs were entered in the number ranges even though I requested this in the “Special Instructions” during set-up.- Empty spaces were filled with “—Blank—“. Take this out and leave the space blank / empty.Pricing - 71 + 245 = 316 fields X 435 (House of Rep Reports) = 137,460 fields needed. Contact vendor for special pricing: http://captricity.com/pricing/- Ad Hoc basis: .20 cents per field- Price per field gets lower with increase in fields. In ConclusionMore investigation is needed to evaluate whether or not to use Captricity. The setup of templates takes a long time, but with more experience, the copy function could be used and the total time for setup would decrease. In the fields with ranges of amounts of dollars, I assumed that a person / crowd-sourcee was doing this work so I outlined the box in the setup to include all information.CRP / OpenSecrets.org should follow up with this vendor and discuss possible solutions for making the templates and pricing. Next: Investigate https://www.documentcloud.org/home
